## 👨‍🔬 My Role (Dadi Naveen)

I designed this as a supply chain solution aligned to Abheshu Pharma’s global sourcing strategy. It reflects real workflows like RFx handling, vendor onboarding, and regulatory alignment — built with tools I’ve used in prior roles.

This project isn’t just a simulation — it’s a mindset I’d bring to your team.
