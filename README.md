**Managing Director & CEO, Abheshu Pharma LLC – Texas, USA**

Dear Vanitha Mam,  
Your bold vision and tireless leadership in building Abheshu Pharma into a global sourcing leader is truly inspiring. You’ve shown the world how science, supply chain, and service can unite.

## 💡 About This Project

This dashboard was built for **Abheshu Pharma** to simulate and support strategic decisions in global pharmaceutical sourcing. It reflects how I would think and operate as an **Associate Manager – Global Sourcing** by turning supplier data into action.

It tackles critical pain points in sourcing APIs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients), RLDs (Reference Listed Drugs), FDFs (Finished Dosage Forms), and comparator drugs — all through a data-driven lens.
