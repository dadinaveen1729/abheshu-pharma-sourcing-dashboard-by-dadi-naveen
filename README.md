**Managing Director & CEO, Abheshu Pharma LLC – Texas, USA**

Dear Vanitha Mam,  
Your bold vision and tireless leadership in building Abheshu Pharma into a global sourcing leader is truly inspiring. You’ve shown the world how science, supply chain, and service can unite.

## 💡 About This Project

This dashboard was built for **Abheshu Pharma** to simulate and support strategic decisions in global pharmaceutical sourcing. It reflects how I would think and operate as an **Associate Manager – Global Sourcing** by turning supplier data into action.

It tackles critical pain points in sourcing APIs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients), RLDs (Reference Listed Drugs), FDFs (Finished Dosage Forms), and comparator drugs — all through a data-driven lens.

This is a real-time sourcing dashboard built specifically for **Abheshu Pharma**, focusing on the key components of pharmaceutical supply chains — APIs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients), RLDs (Reference Listed Drugs), FDFs (Finished Dosage Forms), supplier OTIF performance, cost benchmarking, and compliance.

### 💡 Why was this created?
To demonstrate how data can drive better procurement decisions and supplier relationships. This dashboard was built as a role-specific solution to show exactly how I, Dadi Naveen, would approach global sourcing challenges using analytics, with the goal of aligning with Abheshu Pharma’s mission of “Delivering Health Worldwide.”

### 🛠️ How does it help Abheshu Pharma?
This dashboard helps you:
- Benchmark supplier performance using OTIF (On-Time In-Full) metrics
- Spot lead time variability and improve logistics predictability
- Track GMP compliance risks before they affect delivery timelines
- Compare cost per unit across different suppliers for smart sourcing
- Evaluate vendor readiness for APIs, RLDs, and FDFs
- Enhance audit readiness and cross-functional visibility

These tools allow the sourcing and compliance team to make smarter, faster, and more consistent procurement decisions globally.
