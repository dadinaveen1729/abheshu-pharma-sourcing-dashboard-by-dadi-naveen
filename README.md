## 💡 About This Project

This dashboard was created specifically for **Abheshu Pharma** to simulate and support global pharmaceutical sourcing. It addresses common challenges in sourcing APIs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients), RLDs (Reference Listed Drugs), FDFs (Finished Dosage Forms), comparator drugs, and excipients from international suppliers.

As an aspiring **Associate Manager – Global Sourcing**, this project reflects how I think, plan, and execute sourcing decisions that are:

- Compliant
- Predictable
- Cost-efficient
- Supplier-transparent
